{"Math": {"Question": "Consider the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The graph of $f(x)$ passes through the points $(1, 6)$, $(2, 11)$, and $(3, 18)$. Analyze the given points and the form of the function to determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Show all your steps and justify your reasoning.", 
          "Answer": "To find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can set up a system of equations using the given points by substituting them into the function $f(x)$. \n\nFor $(1, 6)$: $6 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c$ \nFor $(2, 11)$: $11 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c$ \nFor $(3, 18)$: $18 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c$ \n\nSolving this system of equations will give us the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nGrading rubric: \n- Setting up the system of equations correctly (2 points) \n- Correctly using algebraic methods to solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$ (3 points) \n- Justifying each step of the solution (2 points) \n- Arriving at the correct solution for $a$, $b$, $c$ (3 points)", 
          "Student Response": "For (6,1) $F(1) = a1^2 + b1 +c = 6 \\implies a + b + c = 6$ \n For (2,11) $F(2) = a2^2 + b2 + c = 11 \\implies 4a + 2b + c = 11$ \n For (3,18) $F(3) = a3^2 + b3 + c = 18 \\implies 9a + 3b + c = 18$ \n When these three equations are solved \n a=1 , b=2 , c=3 so \n $F(x)=x^2 + 2x + 3$"
