{"1": "These questions test basic recall and comprehension. They are straightforward, requiring students to remember and understand fundamental concepts, such as recalling facts, explaining simple concepts, or identifying basic principles. No complex analysis or synthesis is needed.", "2": "Questions at this level require students to apply their understanding of concepts to new situations. They might have to perform calculations, interpret data, or apply multiple steps of reasoning. The questions are more challenging than level 1 but still focus on fundamental concepts within a single subject area.", "3": "At this level, students must demonstrate a solid grasp of the material by analyzing and applying concepts in more complex ways. Questions may involve solving problems that require a deeper understanding of the subject matter, including the ability to compare, contrast, or integrate different pieces of information.", "4": "These questions demand a high level of understanding across multiple subject areas. Students must analyze complex information and make judgments about its relevance or accuracy. They may need to synthesize information from different sources or disciplines to arrive at a solution.", "5": "The most challenging questions, requiring an advanced level of knowledge and intellectual ability. Students must create new solutions or perspectives by evaluating and integrating information from multiple areas of study. These questions test the highest order of cognitive skills, including the ability to theorize, design experiments, or predict outcomes based on in-depth knowledge."}
