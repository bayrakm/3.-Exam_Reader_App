{"1": {"Question": "A bag contains red, blue, and green marbles. The number of each color marble is unknown, but the total number of marbles is known to be 30. You are to design a game involving drawing a marble from the bag without looking, where players win a prize if they draw a red marble. Create a set of rules for the game that includes the probability of winning a prize, and explain how changing the number of red marbles affects the probability of winning. Assume you have the freedom to decide how many marbles of each color are in the bag, but there must be at least one marble of each color. Illustrate your answer with at least two different scenarios and provide the calculations for the probability of winning in each case.", "Answer": "The solution will vary depending on the rules and scenarios created by the student.

If a baker has 1 kilogram of sugar, how much flour is needed to keep the proportions the same?", "Answer": "First, we need to find the ratio of flour to sugar in the recipe. We have 250 grams of flour for every 75 grams of sugar, which simplifies to a ratio of \\( \\frac{250}{75} \\). Simplifying this ratio gives us \\( \\frac{10}{3} \\). This means that for every 3 parts of sugar, we need 10 parts of flour. \n\nSince the baker has 1 kilogram (or 1000 grams) of sugar, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. Let's use \\( x \\) to represent the amount of flour needed. \n\nWe have: \\( \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{x}{1000} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying gives us: \\( 3x = 10000 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us: \\( x = \\frac{10000}{3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 3333.33 \\) grams of flour are needed.\n\nTherefore, the baker needs 3333.33 grams (or 3.333 kilograms) of flour to keep the proportions the same.", "Topic": "Ratio, Proportion and Rates of Change", "Subtopic": "Working with Ratios and Proportions", "Difficulty Level": "3", "Blooms Class": "Remembering", "Grading Rubric": {"Step 1: Identifying the ratio": "1 point", "Step 2: Simplifying the ratio": "1 point", "Step 3: Setting up the proportion": "2 points", "Step 4: Cross-multiplying to solve for x": "2 points", "Step 5: Dividing to find the value of x": "1 point", "Step 6: Stating the final answer with correct units": "1 point"}}, "5": {"Question": "Consider the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.
